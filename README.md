I guess one has to start somewhere; this is it for me, I think.

Let's see how this goes...

There's nothing much I'd like to say at this point, and at the same time, I have so many things I would very much like to explore publicly. In a way, this makes me human, and from here, I'll exist from nowhere, literally, I think.

Learning in public makes me visible if, well, someone visits my site.

The thing is, I could very easily create a social media account—probably tens of them—and possibly attract relatively more people than creating my own web space.

But those kinds of people, I can already tell, won't take interest in what I will share or where this is going. I'm not interested in surface-level surfers; I'm interested in seekers. People who dare to seek something they're not really sure of but who know, in the depths of their being, that there's something more to life.

This is going to be my personal approach to contemplative living. A life of silence and observation. Our modern society has turned us into tourists in our own world.

You know how it feels when you go out of your house and you feel these uncomfortable I'm-a-visitor vibes around you? I move a lot, so this is probably why. Also, I don't go outside unless necessary. I know this feeling because I tried my luck outside of this country before, and when I went back, the feeling of being out of place was still there.

It surprised me, really. And now, it's harder for me to snap out of it than to stay in conversation with someone asking for a direction to somewhere near me (they usually imply that the place is just around here somewhere), and then I just end the conversation right away by saying that I'm just new here while actually living here for, I don't know, a year?
