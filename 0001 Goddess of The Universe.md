# **Goddess of The Universe**
## **Suspended in Darkness**
It's literally the darkest place somewhere. And i am not using the word “literally” incorrectly here or to say “darkest” lightly. It appears as if all the light in the world are extinguished from the beginning of time. I am suspended in nothing, not really feeling the weightlessness I’d imagine in this situation but I am not exactly sitting or standing within nothing either.

Then, there’s a flicker of light in front of me. It keeps on trying, a giant wet matchstick kind of trying to make a light in the dark.  After a couple of tries, the flicker, now continuous— started dancing. It’s the most comical flicker of light as if Disney animated it. It is dancing and jumping around, bouncing from one place to another point in the dark, zip-zapping around me.

At arms length, I can reach it if I tried or I thought I can. This is me back in my childhood catching grasshoppers all over again. You want to be very careful not to startle the unsuspecting hoppers before you cage them between your palms, usually crushing it in the process, and I don’t even know why I need to catch anything to begin with, if I am going to be honest, I don’t even know why I do things to this day! Picture a cat in a complete frenzy catching his own tail. After all the cartwheel-barrel-roll, ninja-contourtionist, cat-fu performed, of light started dancing. It is the most comical flicker of light it's as if disney animated it. It is dancing and jumping around from one place in the dark and to another point of darkness. Next thing i know, i am being teleported the way hollywood depicts our pov in a wormhole. I am in this tunnel with colorul walls launching me to somewhere.
